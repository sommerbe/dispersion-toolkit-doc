The strength of this toolkit resides in its native ability to run on computing clusters. High computational resources are needed to compute dispersion of point sets having quite a few $n$ elements, or being in high $\sdim$-dimensional spaces. Regarding complexity classes, this computation typically scales with worst case
\begin{align*}
  \bigO(n^{2d})
\end{align*}
in time.

A collection of procedures carrying out those computations are invoked with the
\begin{align*}
  \text{command line interface,}
\end{align*}
or through executing scripts, or through remote procedure calls in particular in computing clusters.

Providing a graphical user interface is not part of the core of this toolkit.
