   abstract = {We study the dispersion of point sets in the unit square; i.e. the size of the largest axes-parallel box amidst such point sets. It is known that $\liminf_{N\to\infty} N\mathrm{disp}(N,2)\in \left[\frac54,2\right],$ where $\mathrm{disp}(N,2)$ is the minimal possible dispersion for an $N$-element point set in the unit square. The upper bound 2 is obtained by an explicit point construction - the well-known Fibonacci lattice. In this paper we find a modification of this point set such that its dispersion is significantly lower than the dispersion of the Fibonacci lattice. Our main result will imply that $\liminf_{N\to\infty} N\mathrm{disp}(N,2)\leq \varphi^3/\sqrt{5}=1.894427...$}

   abstract = {It is shown that any recognition problem solved by a polynomial time-bounded nondeterministic Turing machine can be “reduced” to the problem of determining whether a given propositional formula is a tautology. Here “reduced” means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},

   abstract = {A large class of computational problems involve the determination of properties of graphs, digraphs, integers, arrays of integers, finite families of finite sets, boolean formulas and elements of other countable domains. Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.},
