The usual computational pipeline up to this chapter is to generate point sets upon which some measures are applied. As soon as any of such previous steps involve stochastic elements, a \enquote{sufficiently} large sequence of this pipeline in the sense of i.i.d. repetitions generates a statistics to be consulted for probabilistic conclusions.

This chapter introduces procedures to estimate such statistics. Currently, the only algorithm computes confidence intervals.
