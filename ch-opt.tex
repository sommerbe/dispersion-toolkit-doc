The question remains whether point sets can be iteratively modified to reduce a selected measure on them as much as possible. This optimisation may contribute academically to the search of particular point sets and their format construction.

This chapter describes procedures which numerically optimise point sets. It starts with dispersion on rectangular regions, being not on the torus,
\begin{align*}
  \fndisp(\fnP_i, \Rrect, \muarea)
\end{align*}
as a special case of (\mref{eq:disp-range}).
