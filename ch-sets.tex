A $\sdim$-dimensional point set comprises the actual data whose properties are to be measured.

This chapter explains procedures available within this toolkit to generate these point sets. Currently, the standard Fibonacci lattice as well as its modification are covered here. For other point sets, an external software needs to be employed, for which transduction becomes necessary. Additionally, a stochastic point set modification procedure, called coordinate swapping, applies to point set streams, which showed potential in helping analysis of bounding minimal dispersion.
