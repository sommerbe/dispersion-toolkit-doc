As a special case of (\mref{eq:disp-range}), dispersion on rectangular regions is
\begin{align*}
  \fndisp(\fnP_i, \Rrect, \muarea).
\end{align*}
Here, only those rectangles $\bm r$ are considered to be bounded by the problem domain $\fdom$, i.e. methods described within this section are not working on the torus.
