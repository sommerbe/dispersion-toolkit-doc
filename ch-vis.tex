Developing advanced point set constructors to excel in some measure might be supported by plotting them within the problem domain, for visual inspection. This chapter covers some utility procedures to draw point sets. Currently, this program is limited to 2 dimensions.

Regarding dispersion with rectangular regions, another procedure draws these regions. These can be streamed by some dispersion measures during its computation. This capability might ease the analysis of point sets as well.
