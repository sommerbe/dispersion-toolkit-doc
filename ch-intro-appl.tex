This toolkit is primarily meant for academical purposes. In detail, it aims at helping mathematicians, physicists and computer scientists conducting research regarding
\begin{itemize}
  \item numerical integration of integro-differential equations,
  \item optimisation of sampling patterns, as well as regarding
  \item theoretical understanding of dispersion measures.
\end{itemize}
Any field intersecting with these fundamental areas may take advantage with this toolkit.

Principally, this platform seeks to motivate
\begin{itemize}
  \item academic collaboration, as well as
  \item scientific reproducibility
\end{itemize}
even further.
